# Welcome to the blog of Ben West - Devops
I am an IT professional with over 14 years working for a number of large outsourcing
companies contracted to a multitude of public sector and private clients within the U.K.  
I have held many roles in this time, including infra engineering (and it's spiritual sucessor 'devops') mostly.
I have also been a delivery manager, technical trainer in a past life.

I try to be an active member of the IT community as much as possible.

Code gets published on Github so others can have a look (or maybe laugh at) what I do!  

This blog got a reboot after having one many years ago I never updated.  Now I think it will be 
valuable again even if it is just for me to have somewhere to drop ideas off and I can laugh at when I look back.  
Or maybe I'm getting forgetful in my old age!
