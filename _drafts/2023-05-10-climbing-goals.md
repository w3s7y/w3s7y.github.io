# UK routes
Not really setting any trad route goals as I don't have anyone to go with :(

If I get the chance I'll try and send these, either for their historic nature or skill required.
 
| Name          | Crag                    | Grade  | Notes                       | 
|---------------|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Grooved Arete | Tryfan East face        | HVD 4a | Just because its a classic  |
| Anything!     | The Dug Out (Grinshill) | \>=f6a | Big roof moves, priority!   |


# Font trip
Holiday in the summer and go check out Fonatinbleau!  Would be nice to send something at 6a or above, 
but I doubt that will happen!
