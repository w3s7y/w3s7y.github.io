Introduction
---
A lot of people have asked me, "How did you get into IT?" and for the most part
I simply answer "I sort of fell into it" which is usually met with confused looks
as if they expected me to say "Well first I got a degree in Computer Science then
I did 3 years at a company where I learnt the trade, did numerous training courses
and now I'm a senior engineer".  Well I'm here to say that while that is a perfectly
legitimate career path, it's not the one I took.  I'm here this morning just to
give some personal insight into how and why I got into IT in general and why I think
it's the career for me!

Starting them young
---
I must not have even been 5 when my mum first got her hands on a "computer".  It was
the early nineties, Bosnia was on the news and Michael Jackson was still in the charts.
I lived at that time in a council house in Wrexham with my mum who was a single parent.
We really didn't have much, mostly handed down furniture and clothes.  My mum did have
a car which we used to go see my nan in on the weekends but other than that it was
about it!  The computer was a Sinclair ZX Spectrum, given to us by a friend.  
Initially I didn't really give it any thought, you plugged it into the TV and then
could type letters into the keyboard and get an output.  "Big deal" I thought to
myself, typewriters do the same and make a better noise when the buttons are pushed.
I went outside to play.

Developing an interest
---
Not long after the appearance of the ZX in our house, it was joined by what would
become the biggest drain of time in my early life... An Amiga Commodore 64.
This was a loaner, my mums boyfriends but it was still a hell of a lot of fun to
learn about.  The tape deck, the commands to load games, the grinding noise it
made as it loaded off tape into memory.  It was here my love for games was set
into stone with the Amiga title "Zak McCracken and the alien mindbenders" a classic
amiga game and one which me and my mum would ultimately spend thousands of hours
on trying to complete (these were the days before guide books, the internet
  (while yes it was invented, it was not at that time for use by mere mortals) and
even gaming magazines).  It was here I began to think about what was on that tape
that made the game play?  How did the Amiga know how to convert those screechy
noises into something that has graphics, sound and input?  When I click "Save" and
then quickly bang an empty tape into the deck and hit "Record" what is it doing?
Quickly my mind had began to turn to wondering how these boxes we plugged into the TV actually _worked_.  

All aboard me hearties
---
Moving on to when I was about 6, I was getting ready to go to school one day and
when I came down the stairs I was greeted by my mum in the living room bent over
the ZX spectrum on the floor with a large manual laid out on the floor and a pad
and pen with some notes on it.  There was about 5-6 lines of text on the screen
and my mum was busy consulting the manual, making a few notes then very carefully
entering a few characters into the buffer, then back to the manual.  I thought
nothing of this as quite often my mum would do this and I genuinely thought nothing
of it and we got ready to go to school.

6 Hours later and my mum came and got me from school, we went home and as I came
into the living room I noticed the TV was still on but now had a *LOT* of lines of
code typed out.  One of my biggest issues ever using this ZX was the fact we didn't
have the memory unit for it.  I.E. it was memory-only.  As I stood there looking
at the possibly hundreds of lines of code my mum came running in "_Don't touch that!_" as she usually did.  But then she sat down and said "Are you ready?".  "Sure"
I replied, not really knowing what I was expecting.  My mum hit "Enter" and my world
would never be the same in two seconds.  

The lines and lines of code disappeared from the screen, it remained black for a
second or so and I remember seeing the look of anger and disappointment in my mums
face, then out of nowhere the entire TV screen filled row-by-row with every colour
imaginable (for a 256 colour computer at least). This I would many years later find
out was a dialect of BASIC programming language, and was my first taste that
words didn't always mean words, something could be taken and become something else
with the help of one of these computers.  Language didn't just represent a means
of communication anymore, it was this day my views of computers and what you could
do with them changed.  Once the demonstration was complete, she unplugged the power
and with that, 6 hours of intensive, errorless input was forgotten (but not by me).

Growing up
---
After that display in the art of possible, it was a long time before I touched
anything else resembling a computer as I spent the next 8 years playing
console games and when I wasn't playing on consoles, playing outside.  I was a very
outdoorsy person and given the choice between playing on my games or going outside
it was always no contest.  Around the time I moved up to secondary school (around 12)
one of my uncles gave us a Apple Macintosh III.  This was our first "real" computer
with memory, disk and cpu in all the right places.  A GUI operating system and
even one of those new fangled pointer devices!  This was a real step up!  After
learning about files, directories and applications my mum also let me disassemble
it and learn about what the parts inside looked like and what they did.  This really
cemented my belief that computers were really quite simple devices once you knew
a bit about them and that with a small amount of physical material, you can really
do amazing things!

How I got into IT
---
So as you can see, my early life was peppered with moments that left me with a
"Thats so cool" feeling whenever I was using computers. However this is not what
I went and did, I left school with "okay" GCSEs.  One 'A' in I.C.T class and the
rest were Bs and Cs.  The college affiliated with my secondary school accepted me
as they always accepted candidates from the "lower" school who had 5 A-C grades
at GCSE.  Therefore I was automatically accepted and enrolled for History, Chemistry,
Physics and finally IT.

After about 4 months it wasn't working for me at college, the IT lessons were really
boring (MS Access databases) and I was beginning to get distracted by everything
else in life that an 18 year old does... I quit college and left to get a job
estimating the price of steel framed buildings.  While this was interesting and
gave me the much needed finance I needed to run my car and go out with my friends,
I knew it wasn't what I wanted to be doing my entire life and that I still wanted
to give IT a go.

Xmas 2008 and my employer were to give me a present I'd never forget, redundancy.
They piled us into the wood shop around 4pm on xmas eve to tell us that due to the
economic crisis, they would be looking to making mandatory redundancies in the new
year.  Many in the company were shaken by the news and I knew at that point my fate
was pretty much guaranteed.  Sure enough when February 2009 rolled around I was
given my redundancy packet and I no longer worked for Browns of Wem.

Now for the "right place, right time" moment.  At that moment in time I was going
out with a girl whos dad worked for Capgemini.  After hearing about my
redundancy he offered to hand my CV in as they were hiring.  Thinking nothing of
it I gave it a quick update to reflect my recently vacated role and gave it to him.  
However I was called in for an interview, then another.  "I can't have been that
impressive, I have no skills!" I thought.  But sure enough after those interviews
I was offered full time employment as a "Deployment engineer".  Taking software
developed by someone and "deploying" (i.e. making it run) on a server for clients
to use.  

Gaining experience
---
In the following 8 years I learnt many new and exciting things, non-MS operating
systems, networking, Java... The list grew and grew and I found myself getting
more and more interested.  If there is one thing in this world I love, it's the
fact that you have never learnt it all, there will always be something else to learn
and there will always be a new challenge.  The last few months have been both the most
demanding and rewarding times in my career.  I am getting to work on production
systems using technology brand new and largely untested at enterprise scale.  However
I won't bloat this blog entry with all that "What am I doing now" stuff as that
is the content of other posts.

Conclusion
---
I will always be thankful to my mum for giving that first taste of programming
and to the nameless guy in this article for handing my CV to Capgemini for
consideration.  I hope this sheds some light or proves to some people that
you don't have to have a degree or any A-Levels to succeed in this game!  Just a
passion for it and letting it show!
