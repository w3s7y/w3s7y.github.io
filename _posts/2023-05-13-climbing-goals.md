# Grade goals
So at the start of the year after 4-5 months of no climbing I'm barely scraping up 5+ / 6a problems outdoors again.

This year I want to rather than push into grade 7 do a bit more consolidation in grade 6, and _keep climbing_ is my
main goal.  All the large breaks just leave me down in skill and taking half the season to get back to full strength. 

So climb more, climb consistently a few times every week and get comfortable flashing 6's!


# UK routes
Not really setting any trad route goals as I don't have anyone to go with :(

If I get the chance I'll try and send these, either for their historic nature or skill required.
 
| Name          | Crag                    | Grade  | Notes                       | 
|---------------|-------------------------|--------|-----------------------------|
| Grooved Arete | Tryfan East face        | HVD 4a | Just because its a classic  |
| Anything!     | The Dug Out (Grinshill) | \>=f6a | Big roof moves, priority!   |


# Font trip
Holiday in the summer and go check out Fonatinbleau!  Would be nice to send something at 6a or above, 
but I doubt that will happen!
